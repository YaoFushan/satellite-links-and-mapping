This application needs a serious overhaul. There are some difficulties with specifics, but 
the overall approach needs some work too.


OOP or no OOP?
Even though I am unfamiliar with Python's OOP...probably OOP is the way to go. It will make
it much easier in the long term to add in more features.


Overall approach
Types of links we want to be able to evaluate:
i. Uplink
    - Consists of TERMINAL -> SATELLITE
ii. Downlink
    - Consists of SATELLITE -> TERMINAL
iii. Crosslink
    - Consists of SATELLITE -> SATELLITE
iv. FORWARD PATH
    - Consists of UPLINK + (optional crosslink) + DOWNLINK
    - For this case, the Uplink TERMINAL refers to a "gateway" owned by the sat operator
    - For this case, the Uplink SATELLITE is in RECEIVE mode
    - For this case, the CROSSLINK is optional but consists of two satellites
    - For this case, the Downlink SATELLITE is in TRANSMIT mode
    - For this case, the Downlink TERMINAL is a USER terminal, in RECEIVE mode
v. RETURN PATH
    - Opposite of forward path

1. COLLECT DATA: all user inputs:
    (First input: type of link)
    1a. Satellite
    - Satellite orbit information (or static lat/lon/alt)
    - Satellite antenna pattern + power output information
    - Satellite's supported MODCODs 
    - The area that the satellite can view - should this be its own object (LinkRegion)?
    - (Advanced) Satellite pointing information (assume nadir for basic case)
    - (Advanced) Satellite crosslink information
    1b. Terminal
    - Only terminal hardware information.
